A library that defines AIND data schema for a behavior experiment.

Runs a simple human behavior experiment with a behavior board to demonstrate the 'full-stack' implementation of the aind-behavior model.

The task is a time estimation task. When a particular visual stimulus is shown, the subject must try and make a response `x` seconds after the stimulus. The time period depends on the stimulus parameters. In this case, gratings with a particular temporal frequency determine what the target time interval `x` should be.

After a response, the subject is shown the difference between the intended time delay and the response time delay.

## General instructions

This repository follows the project structure laid out in the [Aind.Behavior.Services repository](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/Aind.Behavior.Services).

---

## Prerequisites

[Pre-requisites for running the project can be found here](https://allenneuraldynamics.github.io/Aind.Behavior.Services/articles/requirements.html).

---

## Deployment

For convenience, once third-party dependencies are installed, `Bonsai` and `python` virtual environments can be bootstrapped by running:

```powershell
./scripts/deploy.ps1
```

from the root of the repository.

## Generating settings files

The task is instantiated by a set of three settings files that strictly follow a DSL schema. These files are:

- `task_logic.json`
- `rig.json`
- `session.json`

Examples on how to generate these files can be found in the `./examples` directory of the repository. Once generated, these are the only required inputs to run the Bonsai workflow in `./src/main.bonsai`.

The workflow can thus be executed using the [Bonsai CLI](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/cli.html):

```powershell
"./bonsai/bonsai.exe" "./src/main.bonsai" -p SessionPath=<path-to-session.json> -p RigPath=<path-to-rig.json> -p TaskLogicPath=<path-to-task_logic.json>
```

However, for a better experiment management user experience, it is recommended to use the provided experiment launcher below.

## CLI tools

The platform exposes a few CLI tools to facilitate various tasks. Tools are available via:

```powershell
uv run implementation-example <subcommand>
```

for a list of all sub commands available:

```powershell
uv run implementation-example -h
```

You may need to install optional dependencies depending on the sub-commands you run.

## Experiment launcher (CLABE)

To manage experiments and input files, this repository contains a launcher script that can be used to run the task. This script is located at `./src/aind_behavior_implementation_example/launcher.py`. It can be run from the command line as follows:

```powershell
uv run implementation-example clabe
```

Additional arguments can be passed to the script as needed:

```powershell
uv run implementation-example clabe -h
```

or via a `./local/clabe.yml` file. (An example can be found in `./examples/clabe.yml`)

## Primary data quality-control

Once an experiment is collected, the primary data quality-control script can be run to check the data for issues. This script can be launched using:

```powershell
uv run implementation-example data-qc <path-to-data-dir>
```

## Mapping to aind-data-schema

Once an experiment is collected, data can be mapped to aind-data-schema using the `data-mapper` sub-command:

```powershell
uv run implementation-example data-mapper --data-path <path-to-data-dir>
```

## Regenerating schemas

DSL schemas can be modified in `./src/aind_behavior_implementation_example/rig.py` (or `(...)/task_logic.py`).

Once modified, changes to the DSL must be propagated to `json-schema` and `csharp` API. This can be done by running:

```powershell
uv run implementation-example regenerate
```
